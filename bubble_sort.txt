some sort of if statement to compare two numbers
  then do something different if true/false

keep track of two indices
  increment both indices
need two loops
loop through entire array mutiple times

some way to keep track of/tell when a number is in the correct position
so we don't need to check it anymore



keeping track of inputs and outputs

“Ok player 1 rolls a 6. I’ll have to keep track of that”
“Player 1 rolls a 3. Keep track of that"
“Player 2 rolls a 4. Keep track of that"
“Player 2 rolls a 1. Keep track of that"
